# Simple-Controller-Input
A simple XBox Game Controller input manager for every Unity project.

This is a work in progress.
By the end, I want to have every input mapped and available as public accessors to other components.

I will test the API by adding the Xbox controller input to the Prime31 Character Controller 2D project.
